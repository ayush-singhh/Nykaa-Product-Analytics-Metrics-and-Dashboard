1. **Remove Irrelevant Data**: Excluded rows that didnâ€™t align with the business objective, like transactions without key details.
2. **Handle Missing Data**: Replaced missing Description values with 'Unknown' and removed rows with missing or zero CustomerID, Quantity, or UnitPrice.
3. **Remove Duplicates**: Used ROW_NUMBER() to eliminate duplicate transaction entries.
4. **Fix Structural Errors**: Corrected inconsistencies like typos, wrong capitalization, and naming issues.
5. **Convert Data Types**: Ensured correct types (e.g., Quantity as integer, InvoiceDate as DATETIME).
6. **Standardize/Normalize Data**: Made sure units and scales (e.g., price format, quantity) were consistent.
7. **Dealing with Outliers**: Removed outliers using the IQR method or investigated their cause.
8. **Validate Data**: Conducted final checks to ensure data consistency and completeness.

2. Metrics



2. Choosing the right metric
- It should align with the business goals
- level of detail is appropriate for the audience



For the Engagement Dashboard, I followed the "three-by-three rule" - show no more than 3 key areas with 3 core metrics each. This keeps the dashboard focused and digestible.



First Section - 
User Activity Overview:
A time series graph showing DAU/WAU/MAU trends
Average session duration over time
Sessions per user per day

Second Section - 
Feature Engagement:
Feature usage frequency (top 5-7 features)
Time spent per feature
Click-through rates on key elements

Third Section - 
User Behavior:
Session time distribution (24-hour heat map)
User journey flow (simplified version)
Interaction depth (actions per session)
